News article scraping comparison program.

Currently contains hardcoded examples of 2 news articles from the same source: 
The first was the original article, which was flattering to Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders. 
The Second is an altered version of the same article that was released later 
that day and is highly critical of Bernie Sanders.

Program goal is to extract the facts in the form of bullet points and eventually 
merge the two and get a clear, unbiased result.

NOTE:
Program is skipping the first few paragraphs in article 2.
